The font in this file is the property of and copyrighted 
by  Peter Rempel, and is subject to this liberal, fairly 
explicit,  and somewhat lengthy license agreement, which you 
accept by using the files.

Licensed use:
Like most software, this font file remain the property of the author (Peter Rempel). 
You are licensed to use it according to the terms of this agreement, but you do not own them. 

Warranty:
Although I have taken care to see that they work, the fonts are
not warranted to work on your system (or even on mine). You use
them at your own risk. 

Personal Use
The fonts are free for personal use: 
You may use them on any machine that you own or control.
You may alter or modify them, or translate them into any other format 
(please note that you may not distribute a modified or translated font--see below).

You may use the font for writing or symbols, on paper, in
another computer application (e.g. a drawing program), or in
any other medium, as long as the writing or symbols are
neither sold nor published.

Commercial Use:
The fonts may be used to produce published printed material 
(whether it is sold or not), or printed material that is sold 
or done for hire (even if it is not published) if either one 
of the following conditions is met:

Payment of a $10 shareware fee that entitles you to use the
font in perpetuity, but only on one computer at a time, or:

Sending to me one copy of each published, sold, or contracted
work in which a font is used. The fonts may be used to produce 
images for World Wide Web pages:

Commercial organizations must pay the shareware fee (above).

Individuals and non-profit organizations having pages with unrestricted 
access must send me the URL of every page that uses the fonts. 

Educators or students with pages available only locally on a single 
campus or university system must email copies of the pages and graphics.

All other "intranet" use is deemed commercial, 
and the shareware fee must be paid.

The fonts may be included in commercial software after securing
my permission in advance.  I will expect:

Acknowledgment of the authorship of the fonts. 

Receipt of one registerable full version of the software, to
be used or given away as I see fit.  

I may choose to withhold permission to include the font in
software I deem objectionable.

Distribution:
The fonts may be distributed by individuals, bulletin board
systems, FTP sites, WWW sites, etc., without restriction as long
as:

No fee is charged for the fonts (this does not include
subscription or access fees for a bulletin board or online
service). 

All files are included. 

None are modified.


The fonts may be distributed as part of "shareware libraries",
provided that:

All files are included

None is modified

I receive a copy of every different disk or CD containing my
fonts, to use or give away as I see fit.


If you want to distribute a translated version (e.g., Type 1,
Macintosh Truetype) of one of my fonts, please contact me.

For any uses not covered explicitly by this agreement, please 
contact me.

I am always grateful for acknowledgment of my fonts, especially  
if you send samples showing how you have used them.

Even if your use in non-commercial, but you would like to encourage me to produce high quality fonts like this one, your $10 shareware fee will be gratefully accepted.
